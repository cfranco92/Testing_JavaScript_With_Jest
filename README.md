# Testing_JavaScript_With_Jest
Jest, testing JavaScript.

## 2. Tools for JavaScript tests
JavaScript is a very competitive language and curiously it has been one of the languages with more testing framework, but with less culture in the comumunity.
Among the most popular are frameworks such as Ava, Tape, Enzyme, Jasmine, Mocha and Jest.

In this course we will focus on working with Jest, although the other frameworks are important too.

## 3. What are the unit tests?
The unit tests what they do is take all your projects or those blocks of code and break it down into small parts that we are going to test. So, everything we are going through we know that it is working correctly and that there is no problem or bug.

The unit tests check what are standard cases (explicit assumption) that is, they are not perfect. The characteristics of the unit tests are:
* Automatable: They must run without any manual process.
* Total coverage: We must to go through each written block.
* Reusable: We can use them to test other blocks.
* Independents: They can not depend on another test to work.
* Quick to create: They have to be something concise that they try something very particular.
* Avantages of the unit tests:
    * It provides an angile work.
    * Quality of the code.
    * Detect errors fast.
    * It facilitates changes and favors integration.
    * Provides information
    * Reduce the cost.
